Deploy notes

- To deploy to static hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) just connect the repo and use the `build` command.
- For GitHub Pages, this repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to publish the `dist` folder. Configure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and set `pages` branch in the repo settings if needed.
