Simple markdown-powered notes app. Create notes, edit with markdown, and preview live. Notes persist in localStorage for local testing and deployment practice.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Run dev server: npm run dev
3. Build for production: npm run build
4. Serve the built site: npm run preview

Deploy notes

- Static hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) are supported â€” set build to `npm run build` and publish `dist/`.
- Included GitHub Actions workflow will publish `dist/` to GitHub Pages if configured.
